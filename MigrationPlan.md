**Comprehensive Plan for Migrating 150 VMs to Google Cloud**

This detailed strategy focuses on migrating **150 Windows and Linux VMs** to Google Cloud while addressing the following challenges:

1.  **Rising operational costs** for maintaining on-premises data centers.
2.  **Scalability and disaster recovery** to support future growth.
3.  **Compliance with international regulations** (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
4.  **Downtime limit** of under 4 hours for critical services.

The plan avoids unnecessary complexity by focusing on **Google Compute Engine** without using services like Cloud CDN or Load Balancing unless absolutely necessary.

|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Phase 1: Assess** | Inventory existing VMs, categorize workloads (critical vs. non-critical), and plan migrations. | Clear prioritization of VMs for seamless phased migration.                                  |
| **Phase 2: Prepare** | Configure the **us-central1** environment, set up IAM policies, and enable snapshot backups.   | A secure, compliant cloud environment ready for migration.                                  |
| **Phase 3: Pilot** | Migrate a subset of non-critical VMs using **Migrate for Compute Engine** to validate processes. | Identify and resolve migration challenges before bulk transfer.                             |
| **Phase 4: Migrate** | Use **Migrate for Compute Engine** for bulk migration. Replicate critical VMs in advance.      | Ensure smooth migration with downtime under 4 hours for critical services.                 |
| **Phase 5: Test** | Validate all workloads, test disaster recovery, and confirm regulatory compliance.               | Ensure services are operational, scalable, and compliant.                                   |
| **Phase 6: Optimize** | Fine-tune VM configurations for performance and conduct cost analysis for future improvements. | Optimize costs while ensuring peak performance.                                             |
