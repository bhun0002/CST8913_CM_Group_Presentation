# Migration Strategy for E-commerce Application on Google Cloud

## Migration
- Migrate the on-premises application servers to Compute Engine instances with autoscaling and load balancing

## Storage
- **Cloud Storage buckets**: Object storage with multi-region redundancy for disaster recovery.

## Scalability and Availability
- **Cloud Spanner**: A globally scalable database.
- **Cloud Load Balancing**: In front of Compute Engine instances to ensure high availability and distribute traffic across regions.
- **Cloud CDN**: Caches frequently used content for low latency, minimizing load on the application backend.
- **Instance group**: To manage Compute Engine VMs with autoscaling based on demand.

## Disaster Recovery
- Use multi-region buckets for automatic replication across multiple geographic locations.
- Enable high availability with a primary instance and automatic failover to a standby instance in another zone.
- Schedule periodic snapshots of persistent disks and store them in Cloud Storage.

## Messaging Service
- **Cloud Pub/Sub**: To handle asynchronous tasks like order processing or sending notifications.
- **Cloud DNS**: Configure DNS zones and records for your e-commerce application.

## Security
- **Cloud Armor**: To protect against DDoS and other web application attacks. Configure security policies to block malicious traffic and enforce compliance.
- **Secret Manager**: Stores API keys, database passwords, and encryption keys securely.
- **Cloud Security Scanner**: Identifies vulnerabilities in web applications hosted on Google Cloud.

## Compliance
- **Compliance Reports Manager**: Provides on-demand access to critical compliance resources.
