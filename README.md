# Migration Strategy for E-commerce Application on Google Cloud

## Migration stratergy

**Planning and Assessment**
Inventory Audit:
Catalog all applications, databases, and systems (modern and legacy).
Workload Prioritization:
Identify critical systems (e.g., e-commerce applications) and dependencies.
Business Requirements:
Ensure compliance with international regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and define uptime requirements.
Migration Strategy:
Use a hybrid migration approach: rehost (lift-and-shift) critical systems first, modernize legacy systems gradually.

**Pre-Migration Preparation**
Connectivity:
Establish secure connections with Cloud VPN or Dedicated Interconnect between on-premises and Google Cloud.
Resource Allocation:
Plan Compute Engine instances with autoscaling and sufficient resource quotas in target regions.
Backup and Disaster Recovery:
Perform full backups of critical systems and store them in Cloud Storage (multi-region buckets).
Test Environment:
Create staging environments to test application compatibility on Google Cloud.

**Data Migration**
Database Migration:
Use Database Migration Service (DMS) for minimal downtime migration of databases to Cloud SQL or Cloud Spanner.
File Storage Migration:
Transfer unstructured data (e.g., images, documents) to Cloud Storage using gsutil or Transfer Appliance for large datasets.

**Application Migration**
E-Commerce Applications:
Migrate public-facing apps to Compute Engine instances with Managed Instance Groups for scalability and high availability.
Load Balancing:
Configure Cloud Load Balancing to distribute traffic across regions.
Content Delivery:
Use Cloud CDN to cache frequently accessed content, ensuring low latency for global users.
Modernization:
Gradually containerize legacy apps using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for better scalability and management.

**Security and Compliance**
Identity and Access Management (IAM):
Enforce least-privilege policies and configure roles for global teams.
Data Encryption:
Use Cloud KMS to manage encryption keys for data at rest and in transit.
DDoS Protection:
Implement Cloud Armor to protect applications from malicious attacks.
Compliance Monitoring:
Use Compliance Reports Manager and Cloud Audit Logs to meet international standards

**Post-Migration Operations**
Monitoring and Support:
Continuously monitor performance using Cloud Operations Suite.
Regular Updates:
Stay updated with GCP compliance and security patches.
Iterative Modernization:
Gradually refactor remaining legacy systems for cloud-native benefits.

## Storage
- **Cloud Storage buckets**: 
Enables recovery of overwritten or deleted files by keeping multiple versions.
Enable Object Versioning on buckets to retain previous file states for audit or recover

## Scalability and Availability
- **Cloud Spanner**:
Ensures consistent global availability for mission-critical databases.
Distribute database replicas across regions for fault tolerance.

- **Cloud Load Balancing**:
To ensure high availability and distribute traffic across regions.
In front of Compute Engine instances to ensure high availability and distribute traffic across regions.

- **Cloud CDN**:
To reduce latency and improve user experience globally.
Serve cached content closer to users, minimizing load on the application backend.

- **Instance group**:
To ensure automatic scaling and failover for critical workloads.
Use instance groups to manage Compute Engine VMs with autoscaling based on demand.

## Disaster Recovery
- Provides geo-redundant storage for critical backups.
- Use multi-region buckets for automatic replication across multiple geographic locations.
- Enable high availability with a primary instance and automatic failover to a standby instance in another zone.
- Schedule periodic snapshots of persistent disks and store them in Cloud Storage.

## Messaging Service
- **Cloud Pub/Sub**:
 For reliable messaging and decoupling between services
 To handle asynchronous tasks like order processing or sending notifications.
- **Cloud DNS**:
 To manage global domain name resolution with low latency.
 Configure DNS zones and records for your e-commerce application.

## Security
- **Cloud Armor**:
  To protect against DDoS and other web application attacks.
  Configure security policies to block malicious traffic and enforce compliance.
- **Secret Manager**:
  To store and manage sensitive credentials securely.
  Stores API keys, database passwords, and encryption keys securely.

## Compliance
- **Compliance Reports Manager**:
 -Regulatory Compliance:
  Ensures your e-commerce application adheres to international regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS.
-Simplified Audits:
  Provides on-demand access to Google Cloudâ€™s compliance certifications and reports for auditing purposes.
