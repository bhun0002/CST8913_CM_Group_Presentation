# Migration Strategy for E-commerce Application on Google Cloud

## Migration
- Migrate the on-premises application servers to Compute Engine instances with autoscaling and load balancing

## Storage
- **Cloud Storage buckets**: 
Enables recovery of overwritten or deleted files by keeping multiple versions.
Enable Object Versioning on buckets to retain previous file states for audit or recover

## Scalability and Availability
- **Cloud Spanner**:
Ensures consistent global availability for mission-critical databases.
Distribute database replicas across regions for fault tolerance.

- **Cloud Load Balancing**:
To ensure high availability and distribute traffic across regions.
In front of Compute Engine instances to ensure high availability and distribute traffic across regions.

- **Cloud CDN**:
To reduce latency and improve user experience globally.
Serve cached content closer to users, minimizing load on the application backend.

- **Instance group**:
To ensure automatic scaling and failover for critical workloads.
Use instance groups to manage Compute Engine VMs with autoscaling based on demand.

## Disaster Recovery
- Provides geo-redundant storage for critical backups.
- Use multi-region buckets for automatic replication across multiple geographic locations.
- Enable high availability with a primary instance and automatic failover to a standby instance in another zone.
- Schedule periodic snapshots of persistent disks and store them in Cloud Storage.

## Messaging Service
- **Cloud Pub/Sub**:
 For reliable messaging and decoupling between services
 To handle asynchronous tasks like order processing or sending notifications.
- **Cloud DNS**:
 To manage global domain name resolution with low latency.
 Configure DNS zones and records for your e-commerce application.

## Security
- **Cloud Armor**:
  To protect against DDoS and other web application attacks.
  Configure security policies to block malicious traffic and enforce compliance.
- **Secret Manager**:
  To store and manage sensitive credentials securely.
  Stores API keys, database passwords, and encryption keys securely.

## Compliance
- **Compliance Reports Manager**:
 -Regulatory Compliance:
  Ensures your e-commerce application adheres to international regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS.
-Simplified Audits:
  Provides on-demand access to Google Cloudâ€™s compliance certifications and reports for auditing purposes.
